# Delaunay Triangulation

Delaunay triangulation over a set of points _S_ is such a triangulation which satisfies the condition that no point of _S_ lies inside a circumcircle of any of the triangles in the triangulation. It is often denoted _DT(S)_.

In order to make the work with triangles in the triangulation easier, there are a couple of helper extension methods that allow the user to easily determine if two triangles are neighbors in the triangulation, or to set this relationships among them.
